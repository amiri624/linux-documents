### Example 2: Run every minute
```

```
This command runs `hi` as the `root` user every minute.

### Example 3: Run every 2 minutes
```

```
This command runs `hi` as the `root` user every 2 minutes.

### Example 4: Run at specific minutes
```

```
This command runs `hi` as the `root` user at 10:10, 10:20, and 10:30.

### Example 5: Run after every reboot
